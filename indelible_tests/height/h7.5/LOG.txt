/*
  * Random trees always have taxa names that are numbers. 
    e.g. (1:0.1,2:0.1,(3:0.1,4:0.1):0.1);

  * tree1 and tree2 will be unrooted random trees.
  * tree3 and tree4 will be rooted random trees. 

  * Every time that INDELible is run tree2 will produce the same sequence 
    of random trees, until the number after the [seed] command is changed. 
  * The others (tree1, tree3 and tree4) will always produce different trees.
  * Please note that the [seed] command overrules the [randomseed] 
    command from a [SETTINGS] block, for a random tree.

  * tree4 will produce random trees that are always rescaled to have a tree 
    length of 8, and tree3 will produce random trees that are always rescaled 
    to have a depth (root to tip) of 0.4, whilst the other two (tree1 and 
    tree2) will always produce random trees with different tree lengths/depths.

  * The numbers that come after the [unrooted] and [rooted] commands are 
    the same in both cases.  The first number is the number of taxa 
    (10 for tree1 and tree2, 15 for tree3 and tree4).
  * The next  four are the parameters used in the birth-death process to 
    create the random trees. In order, from left to right, these are the 
    birth-rate, death-rate, sampling fraction and mutation rate. 
    Further details on these parameters can be found in this paper: 
    http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/ziheng/pdf/1997YangRannalaMBEv14p717.pdf

  * Trees (random or user) that are used during the simulation will be output 
    by INDELible in a file like this.

  * One last point to remember about random trees is that they CANNOT be 
    used when you want the evolutionary model to be permitted to change 
    over the tree. i.e. they CANNOT be used with [BRANCHES] blocks.
