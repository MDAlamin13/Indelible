IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences 63 and 38 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file t7.seq.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
